<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

<!-- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hey! My Name is Muhammed. I graduated from `UIUC` with a degree in Computer Engineering and now work as a full time software engineer. Not everything fits on my resume. 

I am interested in `distributed systems`, `operating systems`, and infrastructure software. I enjoy designing complex systems and abstract thinking. I am intersted in learning how to build distributed systems and make them reliable and scalable. I’m especially drawn to problems at the boundary between hardware and software, where `low-level` details shape `large-scale` system behavior.

In my freetime I like to play `basketball` and `soccer`. I try to lift when I can.
